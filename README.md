# LightSpeed
LightSpeed is a super fast basic altcoin exchange without registration. It is based upon an API found on the internet
(link in the code somewhere, you will surely find it). I made it because I hated cryptonator for being so great and then
getting unstable. This is the result, and its ugly. So, fellow scripters, lets make it great! A GUI would be nice and I
will make sure it is added at some point. Everything else too. The project is based around JS as I need to get better
at that for school projects and stuff.
